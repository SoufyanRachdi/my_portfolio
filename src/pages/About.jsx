                <p>
                    I am a passionate <span className="text-cyan-400 font-medium">Computer Science student</span> at ISIMG, blending strong foundations in mathematics and physics with practical software engineering skills. I thrive on tackling complex problems and transforming abstract ideas into robust, user-centric solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical journey spans competitive programming, full-stack web development, and game design. From building a restaurant management system in Java to crafting <span className="text-cyan-400 font-medium">immersive 3D worlds in Godot</span>, I treat every project as an opportunity to push my boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm diving deep into <span className="text-cyan-400 font-medium">MkArchi</span>, an open-source ecosystem I created to revolutionize project scaffolding. Creating tools for other developers is a challenge I find uniquely rewarding.
